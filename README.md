## A free, modern, [Astro](https://astro.build/) landing page theme made with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to help kick start your next Astro project

We built this page as the first version of our own website, [blackspike.com](https://www.blackspike.com), but switched to a different design later.

Rather than let it gather dust, we decided to modernise it, try out some fresh new CSS features and give it back to the Astro community.

You can read more about how we built it and the cool new tech we used [on our blog post](https://www.blackspike.com/blog/blackspike-free-astro-tailwind-theme/).

Now available as an official Astro theme! [Download it from the Astro themes page](https://astro.build/themes/details/blackspike-astro-landing-page/)

## Architecture

This project uses a **Ports and Adapters** pattern (also known as Hexagonal Architecture) to separate the core application logic from external services and data sources. This makes the application more modular, easier to test, and simpler to maintain.

The key idea is to define "ports" (interfaces with their associated Data Transfer Objects or DTOs) that our application components use, and then create "adapters" that implement these interfaces to connect to external systems.

All adapters are located in the `src/lib/adapters/` directory.

### The Anatomy of an Adapter

Each feature that interacts with an external data source follows a consistent structure. Let's use the `auth` feature as an example:

-   **The Port (Interface and DTO):** `src/lib/adapters/auth/interface.ts`
    This file defines the `Auth` interface and the `User` DTO. It specifies the contract that any authentication adapter must follow. Application components (like Astro pages) will depend on these application-specific types, not on the data structures of any external service.

-   **The Client:** `src/lib/adapters/auth/mockAuthClient.ts`
    The client is responsible for the low-level details of communicating with the external service and returning its raw data. It is completely ignorant of the application's internal DTOs.

-   **The Adapter:** `src/lib/adapters/auth/authAdapter.ts`
    The adapter is the bridge between the client and the application. Its primary responsibility is to:
    1.  Call the client to fetch raw data.
    2.  **Translate that raw data into the application's DTO (`User`).**
    3.  Implement the `Auth` interface, returning the DTO to the application.

### How to Add a New Adapter

When you need to connect to a new data source (for example, a chat service), follow these steps:

1.  **Create a New Directory:**
    Create a new directory for your feature under `src/lib/adapters/`. For a chat feature, this would be `src/lib/adapters/chat/`.

2.  **Define the Interface and DTO (the Port):**
    Create an `interface.ts` file inside your new directory. Define the DTO for your data (`ChatMessage`) and the interface for the actions (`Chat`).

    ```typescript
    // src/lib/adapters/chat/interface.ts
    export interface ChatMessage {
        // This is the DTO
        id: string;
        message: string; // Use application-specific naming
        from: string;
    }

    export interface Chat {
        getMessages(): Promise<ChatMessage[]>;
        sendMessage(text: string): Promise<void>;
    }
    ```

3.  **Create a Client:**
    Create a client file that handles the actual data fetching. It should return raw data, not DTOs.

    ```typescript
    // src/lib/adapters/chat/mockChatClient.ts
    // This client returns data in a "raw" format, with different naming.
    const rawMessages = [
        { msg_id: "1", msg_text: "Hello!", author_name: "Jules" },
    ];

    export class MockChatClient {
        async getRawMessages() {
            return Promise.resolve(rawMessages);
        }
        async postMessage(text: string) {
            console.log(`Message sent to external service: ${text}`);
            return Promise.resolve({ success: true });
        }
    }
    ```

4.  **Create the Adapter (and Translate):**
    Create an adapter file that implements the interface. This is where you translate the raw data from the client into your application's DTO.

    ```typescript
    // src/lib/adapters/chat/chatAdapter.ts
    import type { Chat, ChatMessage } from "./interface";
    import { MockChatClient } from "./mockChatClient";

    const client = new MockChatClient();

    class ChatAdapter implements Chat {
        async getMessages(): Promise<ChatMessage[]> {
            const rawMessages = await client.getRawMessages();
            // Translate raw data to an array of ChatMessage DTOs
            const messages: ChatMessage[] = rawMessages.map((rawMsg) => ({
                id: rawMsg.msg_id,
                message: rawMsg.msg_text,
                from: rawMsg.author_name,
            }));
            return messages;
        }
        async sendMessage(text: string) {
            await client.postMessage(text);
        }
    }

    export function getChatAdapter(): Chat {
        return new ChatAdapter();
    }
    ```

5.  **Use the Adapter in Your Components:**
    Finally, in your Astro components, import and use your new adapter. The component will receive clean, predictable DTOs.

    ```astro
    ---
    // src/components/ChatComponent.astro
    import { getChatAdapter } from '../lib/adapters/chat/chatAdapter';

    const chat = getChatAdapter();
    const messages = await chat.getMessages(); // messages are ChatMessage[]
    ---
    <!-- Your component HTML here -->
    ```
